# RAIINet

RaiiNet is a game similar to Stratego. There are 2 opposing players, each controlling 8 pieces, called links. 4 of these links are classified as data and the other 4 as viruses. A player wins the game by either downloading
4 data links first, or by making their opponent download 4 virus links. There are also a set of abilities which introduce special interactions and allow for the placement of special links.

This game uses OOP concepts extensively as well as using software design patterns to efficiently manage the different aspects of the game. This implementation also provides the option for either text-based or graphic-based displays,
allowing for a more interactive experience.
